# Project-439
5 MW Wind Power Project by M/s Transport Corporation of India Limited (TCIL) at Rajasthan

Metering equipment:
 All the metering equipments, including transformers, control and relay/ protection panels, metering,
HT lines from the point of generation to the nearest pooling station/ technically feasible point
determined by RVPNL/ Jodhpur Discom as well as their maintenance will be undertaken by the PP or
in association with other PPs/ any other agency as per the specifications and the requirements of the
RVPNL/ Jodhpur Discom, for which PP(s) shall bear the entire cost. The electricity generated by all
the WEGs of the project is being exported through the evacuation facilities to the state owned utility
(RVPNL). 

Metering at substation:
 Metering of net electricity exported is done at the Grid Interconnection point. There are two energy
meters placed at each grid interconnection point - Main meter and Check meter. The Main meter is
used to calculate the net electricity exported by the WEGs to the Grid and the Check meter is used to
cross check the above readings.
 The meter recording of the electricity fed to the state utility grid will be carried out jointly (by both
RVPNL & the PP(s) representative) at the respective incoming feeders (metering points) of the state
electricity utility (RVPNL).
 Meter reading taken jointly will be signed by the representatives of the RVPNL and/or Jodhpur
Discom and of PP in the Joint Monitoring Report (JMR). If PP’s representative is not present, then
the RVPNL and/or Jodhpur Discom shall provide PP with a signed copy of the meter reading within
twenty four (24) hours of such reading of the Main Meter or Check Meter as the case may be
 Breakup sheet is prepared by the EPC contractor i.e. “Suzlon Energy Limited” to show the generation
of individual turbines/ investors and this individual generation is calculated using apportioning
(explained later in the monitoring plan). 

As per the Schedule 1 of Ministry of Environment and Forests (Government of India) notification dated
January 27, 1994, - 30 activities are required to undertake environmental impact assessment studies. The
details of these activities are available at:
http://envfor.nic.in/divisions/iass/notif/eia.htm

The proposed project doesn’t fall under the list of activities requiring EIA as it will not involve any
negative environmental impacts, as the WEGs installed for generation of power use wind (cleanest
possible source of renewable energy), thus no EIA study was conducted.

The installations of Baramsar and Soda Mada wind farm have been carried out on barren land owned by
the revenue department of the state government. The state government has leased out the land to for a
period of 19 years for erection and commissioning of WEGs. All the necessary clearances from the revenue department have been obtained for commissioning and
operation of wind farm. The Baramsar and Soda Mada villages are nothing but scattered hamlets of few habitants residing near the
project site. The villagers have been apprised by the state government revenue department about the wind
farm prior to leasing out the land.
